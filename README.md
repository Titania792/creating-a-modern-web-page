This repository contains my development during the course "Create a modern website" by Jordan Alexander(Information Technology Engineer) in Udemy.

#### [My Web Page](https://titania792.github.io/creating-a-modern-web-page/)

Throughout this course I learned how to create a mobile responsive website, how to design a website from scratch with HTML5, then I went on to design it with CSS using design techniques such as Flexbox and then give it interactivity with Javascript, creating a responsive menu and a lightbox gallery, all without any library or framework.

#### What I learned douing the course:
- Learn how to create a web page
- How to use Javascript in the browser
- DOM
